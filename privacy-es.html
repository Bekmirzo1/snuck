                                    WHEREAS, [SNACK] has developed technology – an Application that allows users to
                                    share
                                    their Internet traffic with [SNACK] and its clients via their device. The user's
                                    device
                                    becomes a gateway that enables [SNACK] to send traffic using the device and its
                                    Internet
                                    traffic. This shared Internet traffic will be used by [SNACK] and its clients.

                                    device's network sharing settings so they could become a gateway for Internet
                                    traffic.
                                    Subsequently, the user's device is used as a gateway by [SNACK]'s clients. These

                                    current and relevant information. You understand that we may not be able to pay out
                                    any of your Earnings defined in this Agreement if you fail to provide such
                                    information or documentation, or if the information or documentation you provide is
                                    not correct, complete, or up-to-date. You might also not be able to receive your
                                    Earnings if your country of residency does not support any of the payment methods
                                    [SNACK] offers. Where applicable, [SNACK] shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
                                    from any consideration payable such amounts as are required to be deducted or

                                    Any claim for inaccurate payouts of your Earnings must reach us within 60 (sixty)

                                    Default functionality: The total Earnings (E) you have accumulated are displayed in
                                    the Dashboard next to the number of Credits associated with your personal account.
                                    Earnings' monetary value is calculated by multiplying the number of Credits (C) and
                                    the applicable Conversion rate (CR). The amount of Credits allocated depends on the
                                    applicable Sharing rate (SR) and the amount of Shared traffic you have managed to
                                    provide. Shared traffic (ST) is multiplied by the applicable Sharing rate (SR). A
                                    small amount of Internet traffic is used for the operation of [SNACK]'s
                                    infrastructure. This amount is not deemed as Shared traffic.
